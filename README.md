# sql-data-warehouse-project
SQL data warehouse project using an ETL pipeline with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to transform raw data into analytics-ready tables
SQL Data Warehouse Project (ETL)
Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a SQL-based data warehouse using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The architecture follows the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layered approach to convert raw data into analytics-ready datasets.

Architecture

Bronze Layer: Stores raw data ingested from source systems with minimal processing.

Silver Layer: Cleans, validates, and transforms data for consistency and quality.

Gold Layer: Contains curated, business-ready tables optimized for reporting and analytics.

Technologies Used

SQL

Data Warehouse Architecture (Bronze / Silver / Gold)

ETL Concepts

Draw.io (for architecture design)

Key Features

Structured ETL pipeline

Layered data warehouse design

Focus on data quality, transformation, and analytics readiness

Clear separation of raw, processed, and refined data

Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice data warehousing fundamentals, ETL workflows, and SQL transformations, following industry-standard architecture used in real-world analytics systems.
