/**

Purpose of the Script: Gold Layer Refinement and Star Schema Construction
The primary purpose of this script is to architect the Gold Layer of the data warehouse by transforming cleaned data from the Silver layer into
a Star Schema specifically optimized for Business Intelligence and analytical reporting. By creating the dim_customers, dim_products, and fact_sales 
views, the script centralizes fragmented data from CRM and ERP systems into a unified "Single Source of Truth." It implements critical business logic, 
such as consolidating gender data via COALESCE, filtering for active product records, and generating surrogate keys using ROW_NUMBER(). Ultimately, this
script abstracts complex data relationships into user-friendly, high-performance structures that allow analytical tools like Power BI or Tableau to perform 
fast, reliable aggregations and multi-dimensional analysis.
